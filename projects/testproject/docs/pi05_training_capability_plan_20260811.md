BLOCKER      checkpointing is BROKEN with 8-bit Adam. A 30k-step run that cannot
             write a checkpoint produces NOTHING. Everything else is downstream.
UNMEASURED   phase 1 fit BECAUSE it ran at batch size 1 with no gradient
             accumulation. Effective batch 1 is a TRAINING-QUALITY risk: if the
             resulting policy is bad you cannot tell whether it was the batch
             size, the data, or the approach. Worst kind of result from a
             multi-hour run.

# §A THE AUTONOMY CONTRACT — read before running anything unattended

**Operator asked for this to run without a permission prompt at each step. That
is reasonable for the mechanical work and NOT reasonable for everything.** The
split below is drawn from what actually stopped phase 1: a gated licence, an
auth token, and one script that would have written to someone else's public
dataset.

## 🟢 GREEN — run these unattended, no prompt

```text
· read GPU / disk / process state
· create, patch, or rebuild the PROBE venv at sim/pi05-fullft-probe
· pip/uv install INTO the probe venv
· patch site-packages INSIDE the probe venv, with .orig kept alongside
· run lerobot-train on ALREADY-CACHED datasets, any batch size, any step count
· write to ~/lerobot_assets/probes/**  and  results/**
· compute dataset stats LOCALLY (write_stats only)
· commit to this repo, including the doc and result artefacts
```

## 🔴 RED — STOP AND ASK, every time, no exceptions

```text
· ANY upload: push_to_hub, hf upload, create_tag, or writing to a Hub repo
  ⚠ lerobot's own augment_dataset_quantile_stats.py CALLS push_to_hub AND tags
    the repo. libero_spatial_image is HuggingFace's PUBLIC dataset, not ours.
    Now that a token exists this would SUCCEED rather than fail harmlessly.
    Use results/pi05_fullft_5090_20260811/add_quantile_stats_local.py instead.
· accepting a licence or gating agreement (e.g. a new gated model repo)
· anything involving credentials or tokens
· touching sim/Isaac-GR00T-n16/.venv, sim/leisaac-venv, or projects/testproject/.venv
· deleting or overwriting an existing checkpoint, dataset, or results directory
· patching this repo's src/lerobot (phase 1 showed it is not even what runs)
· STEP 4 of this plan — it spends the 89 real episodes. Human decision.
```

## ⏹ STOP CONDITIONS — abort the sequence and report, do not "work around"

```text
· an OOM at batch size 1              → contradicts phase 1; something changed
· loss NaN or inf                     → real defect, not a tuning problem
· torch is not 2.7.1+cu128            → a silent downgrade invalidates STEP -1
· trainable != total in a full-FT run → Gate B failure; everything after is void
· a step needs a NEW gated repo       → RED
· >2 consecutive failures of the same step for different reasons
    → the environment is not what this doc assumes. Stop and re-verify.
```

⇒ **Report at each step boundary regardless.** Unattended means "no permission
prompt", not "no reporting".

# STEP 1 — fix checkpointing with 8-bit Adam  `[~30 min]` 🟢

**This is the blocker. Nothing else matters until it is done.**

## The defect

```text
ValueError: Key `state/1/step` is invalid, expected torch.Tensor
            but received <class 'int'>
```

`bnb.optim.AdamW8bit` keeps its step counter as a **python int**;
`_save_single_optimizer_state` flattens the state dict straight into
`safetensors.save_file`, which accepts tensors only.

```text
site-packages/lerobot/optim/optimizers.py
  _save_single_optimizer_state   ~L334   flat_state = flatten_dict(state)
                                         save_file(flat_state, ...)   ← here
  _load_single_optimizer_state   ~L372   unflatten_dict(load_file(...))
```

## The fix

Coerce non-tensor scalars to 0-d tensors on save. Keep it narrow — scalars only,
and do not silently swallow anything unexpected:

```python
flat_state = {
    k: (v if torch.is_tensor(v) else torch.tensor(v))
    for k, v in flatten_dict(state).items()
}
```

⚠ **The load path is the half that is easy to declare done without testing.**
`torch`/`bnb` generally accept a tensor `step`, but that is an assumption until a
round-trip proves it. **A save that cannot be resumed from is not a fix.**

## Acceptance — and it closes phase 1's one open gap for free

```text
1  10-step run, --save_checkpoint=true --save_freq=10   → checkpoint WRITES
2  RESUME from it for 5 more steps                      → loads, loss finite
3  ★ compare a VLM backbone tensor in the checkpoint against pi05_base
   → norm CHANGED  ⇒ THE WEIGHTS-MOVED CHECK phase 1 could not perform,
     because it depended on the checkpoint that failed to write. Same task.
```

⇒ Capture as `patches/lerobot_061_optimstate_scalar_fix.patch`, alongside the
8-bit patch. **site-packages is not version controlled.**

# STEP 2 — largest batch that fits  `[~20 min]` 🟢

**The highest-value measurement available, and it is 20 minutes.** It converts
*"it fits"* into *"it is practical"*, and it decides whether gradient
accumulation — an unimplemented second code change — is needed at all.

## Why it is likely to succeed

Phase 1: peak 24.74 GiB with **7.10 GiB headroom**, and activations at bs1 look
under ~1 GiB with checkpointing on. If activations scale roughly linearly, bs4–bs8
plausibly fits. **Plausibly is not measured.**

## Arms

```text
batch_size ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8}   30 steps each, otherwise the phase-1 config exactly
STOP at the first OOM - do not continue up the ladder
record per arm:  peak VRAM (nvidia-smi 1 Hz) · lerobot mem_gb · steps/s ·
                 SAMPLES/s (= steps/s × batch)  ← the number that matters
```

⚠ **Compare samples/s, never steps/s, across batch sizes.** Phase 1 §6 made
exactly this error with the old bs4 baseline; steps/s across different batch
sizes flatters the smaller batch by the batch ratio.

## Decision rule — written before the result

```text
max batch >= 8    gradient accumulation NOT needed. Quality concern largely
                  evaporates. Go to STEP 3 at that batch.
max batch 4       usable. Note the gap to the reference recipe's 32 and decide
                  at STEP 3 whether to close it with accumulation.
max batch 1-2     gradient accumulation IS needed → a second code change
                  (~15 lines, Accelerator(gradient_accumulation_steps=...) plus
                  the update_policy() step gating). Do it BEFORE STEP 3.
```

# STEP 3 — the LIBERO capability run  `[~8 h]` 🟢

**This is the run that actually answers the operator's question.**

## ⇒ Use LIBERO, NOT the 89 real episodes. On purpose.

```text
IN DOUBT, and this run settles it:
  sustained throughput over hours (phase 1 measured 34 seconds)
  thermal behaviour under a long load
  memory stability - does peak drift or fragment over 10k+ steps?
  a full checkpoint round-trip that RELOADS

NOT in doubt, and using real data would entangle it:
  whether our corpus is any good
```

⇒ **A capability test should have exactly one unknown.** LIBERO already runs
end-to-end here as of phase 1. Spending the real episodes on a hardware question
mixes two investigations, which is the failure mode this whole lane has been
avoiding.

## Configuration

```text
batch size    the STEP 2 maximum
steps         enough for ~96k samples - LeRobot's own pi05 example is
              --batch_size=32 --steps=3000 (docs/source/pi05.mdx)
              ⇒ at bs8 that is 12,000 steps; at bs1, 96,000
save_freq     2000, and NOT save_checkpoint=false - checkpointing is the point
log_freq      100
```

## Instrument beyond phase 1 — long runs fail differently

```text
nvidia-smi --query-gpu=timestamp,memory.used,utilization.gpu,temperature.gpu,\
           clocks.sm,power.draw --format=csv -l 5   ← temps and CLOCKS: thermal
                                                      throttling is invisible in
                                                      a 34-second probe
```

## Acceptance

```text
run completes · peak VRAM stable (no upward drift) · no thermal throttle
loss finite and trending down · checkpoint RELOADS and produces finite actions
⇒ then, and only then, "we can train π0.5 on the 5090" is a measured claim
```

# STEP 4 — our own data  🔴 NEEDS A HUMAN DECISION

**Do not start this unattended.** Not for technical reasons — the corpus
composition is a research decision with consequences.

```text
⚠ MIXING state-machine-generated data WITH recorded episodes is a
  distribution-mixing choice that has never been done on this project. Doing it
  in the same run that also validates the hardware means TWO unknowns at once.
  STEP 3 exists so that by this point the hardware is not one of them.

⚠ The 89 real episodes still need v3.0 -> GR00T v2 conversion and a `top` camera
  drop.

⚠ sim_to_real_preflight_protocol_20260806.md carries a STANDING RULE that no
  training is justified yet, because two mechanically-fixable defects remain in
  the observation channel. That rule is about solving sim-to-real TRANSFER, so
  it does not block a capability test - but it is a live argument against
  spending the real episodes here. See
  sim_to_real_camera_alignment_20260809.md.
```

⇒ **Bring the corpus question back to the operator with STEP 2 and STEP 3
results in hand.** The right composition depends on what batch size and
throughput turn out to be available.
